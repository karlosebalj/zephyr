      The interrupt signal from the controller is active low in push-pull mode.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
      that is presented to the driver.

      Enables controller PLL, which multiples input clock frequency x10.
      This parameter also implicity sets whether the clock is from the PLL
      output or directly from the oscillator.
      If this option is enabled the clock source is the PLL, otherwise its
      the oscillator.
